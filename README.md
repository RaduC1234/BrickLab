## ðŸ“š Learning Approach

1. **Assemble** the hardware following an interactive schematic.
2. **Drag-and-drop** code blocks inside the app to program the device.
3. **Upload** the generated code to the microcontroller via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
4. **Watch** your IoT creation come to life!
5. **Iterate and improve** by exploring new challenges and tutorials.
